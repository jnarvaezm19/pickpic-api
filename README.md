### Anotations ###
This is also my first NodeJs app, but I felt so good develop this API RestFul App because this is a simple, useful and good technology to do this kind of app. 
So.. why NodeJs? I choose NodeJs to develop this API RestFul app because also is a popular technology and further you actually use that, even you wrote in the "Play rules" that "for the
backend test, we are looking for javascript developers, so if you choose to use node, that
might add up some extra points.", so I accepted your technical test but also I set a challange to me and thats was make this technical test in this technology to show me that I can do whatever challange, obviously I have a lot of thing to improve.
